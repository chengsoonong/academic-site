### Organisation
Academic service, including:
- Organising conferences or workshops
- Editorships or reviewing services

So that people looking for new editors or new reviewers know that you have experience.

### Teaching

All things academic:
- current and past courses
- student projects supervised


### Talks

In computer science, publications at conferences usually include talks.
However, there may be other talks you give that are not related to your publications.
